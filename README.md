## General info
This was my first more complicated project based on REST API and communication with third party's servers.

The biggest challenges in this project:

* to translate data recieved from a Youtube account in a way that would be readable by Spotify's servers.
* to establish the authorization process for both services

## Setup
To test this project you need to download this repositry and emulate it in Android Studio.

To do that you have to download and install Android environment:
* JDK & JRE - https://developer.android.com/studio/install
* Android SDK - https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiM3KST4aztAhVNAxAIHSRACHcQFjACegQIFhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fstudio&usg=AOvVaw3fIlahucURgOEYHHhVdQuW

After that you can simply import this repository to Android Studio and run it on AVD.

You can also download .apk file and install it straight on your Android device!
